  - Studied the requirements.
  - Spent some time to consolidate the knowledge of RESTFul API.
  - Initially implemented a test app who acts as a terminal based on Python/Requests/Json.
  - Spent some time to setup cMock and wrote a simple test case.
  - Spent some time to setup libmicrohttpd.
  - Make "create a terminal" work between test terminal and app with some dummy code. 
    
- 03/06 Sun (10am - 12:30pm) (will be in the church in the afternoon :-))
  - Restructured the code
  - Initial implementation of terminal_management.
  - Implemented ParseEndPointFromUrl and unit tested it.

  Coninued the work...
  So far I've achieved 
  - Application
    - I used Dev-c++ as an IDE to create a project for this test. Please install Dev-c++ to build the project. Need to modify the makefile to make it support unix as well.
      - src/main.c
        - It starts a daemon to receive http requests.
        - Need to start a thread to start the daemon.
      - src/end_points.c
        - It provides the interfaces to handles request services.
      - src/data_handler.c
        - It handles JSON data serialize and deserialize. 
        - In the future it needs to implement a general JSON parser or integrate a JSON lib.
      - src/terminal_manager.c
        - It manages terminal data CRUD. So far only create and read are implemented.
      - src/types & src/AT91SAM7X256.h
        - Irrelevant to the applicaiton. They're there only because they're referenced by cmock and the rake file. Need to remove them later.  
    - API "create terminals" 
      - implemented, but it has a problem to get post data correcly. From libmicrohttpd's doc upload_data in the request handling call back function is empty for the first time and afterwards it will have value. It failed acceptance test anyway. 
    - API "get terminal details"
      - implemented, tested.
    - API "get termainl list"
      - implementation not complete.
  - Unit test
    - I used cmock to unit test functions in data_handler.c and terminal_manager.c.
    - Since I had not much time to learn how to get cmock integrted into my project I copied rake files from an example in cmock, and I hard coded the path in a couple of places. Need to use env variable to remove hard coded path.
    - To run it
      - install cmock.
      - modify UTest/gcc.yml : line 12 according to your cmock path.
      - modify UTest/rakefile_helper.rb : lines 3,4,5 according to your cmock path. 
      - under UTest, run cmd 'rake'.
  - Acceptance test
    - I used python to write a test app, under folder ATest.
    - It is used to test web APIs create_terminal and get_terminal_details.
    - Verification needs to be improved.
    - Need to adopt an automation framework to test automatically.
  - Other issues needed to address
    - Better understand libmicrohttpd's threading mode and choose the right one.
    - Buffer/memory management. Check mem leak with valgrind.
    - Address inconsistent code style.
    - Unit test end_points.c
